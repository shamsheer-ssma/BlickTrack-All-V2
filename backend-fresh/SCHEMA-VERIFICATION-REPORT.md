## 🌳 Hierarchical Architecture Verification

### Unlimited Hierarchy Support ✅
```sql
-- Projects can have unlimited depth
Project {
  parentId   String?           -- References parent project
  children   Project[]         -- Child projects
  level      Int               -- Depth level (0=root)
  path       String?           -- Materialized path for fast queries
  isRoot     Boolean           -- Root level indicator
  isLeaf     Boolean           -- Leaf level indicator
}

-- Hierarchy types support any structure
enum ProjectHierarchyType {
  PROJECT      // Individual project (leaf level)  
  PRODUCT      // Product containing multiple projects
  PORTFOLIO    // Portfolio of products/projects
  PROGRAM      // Program management level
  INITIATIVE   // Strategic initiative level
  WORKSTREAM   // Sub-project workstream
}
```

### Permission Inheritance System ✅ 
```sql
-- Permissions inherit down the hierarchy
ProjectHierarchyPermission {
  permission   String          -- "read", "write", "admin", "manage_children"
  isInherited  Boolean         -- Inherited from parent?
  inheritLevel Int?            -- From which level inherited
}
```
